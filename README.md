#Virtual Tour Guide

In a narrow definition, deepfake (stemming from “deep learning” and “fake”) is 
created by techniques that can superimpose face images of a target person onto a 
video of a source person to make a video of the target person doing or saying 
things the source person does. Deepfake technology can seamlessly stitch anyone 
in the world into a video or photo they never actually participated in.
Recently, we found that this technology was only used for fun and entertainment, 
so we thought to use it for something useful. Hence the idea of using it in 
museums, archaeological sites, as tourist guide to make the statues talk and 
represent themselves virtually and tell their entire history (Name, Dynast, Their 
achievements, etc.)
